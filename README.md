Conjur API for Java
===================

## Installation

### From Source

To build the library from source you'll need Maven.  You can build it like this:

```bash
git clone {repo}

cd conjur-api-java

mvn package -DskipTests

```

If you are using Maven to manage your project's dependencies, you can run `mvn install` to install the package locally, and then include following dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.conjur.api</groupId>
  <artifactId>conjur-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.2</version>
</dependency>
```

If you aren't using Maven, you can add the `jar` in the normal way. This `jar` can be found in
the `target` directory created when you ran `mvn package`.

Note that we ran `mvn package` without running the integration tests, since these require access to a Conjur instance. You can run the 
integration tests with `mvn package` once you finished with the configuration.

### Configuration

The simplest way to configure the Conjur API is by using environment variables, which is often a bit more convenient. 
Environment variables are mapped to configuration variables by prepending `CONJUR_` to the all-caps name of the 
configuration variable. For example, `appliance_url` is `CONJUR_APPLIANCE_URL`, `account` is `CONJUR_ACCOUNT` etc.  

The following environment variables are mandatory for running the API: CONJUR_ACCOUNT, CONJUR_CREDENTIALS & CONJUR_APPLIANCE_URL.

CONJUR_ACCOUNT - account specified during Conjur setup
CONJUR_APPLIANCE_URL - Conjur HTTPS endpoint
CONJUR_CREDENTIALS - user/host identity & user/host API key (written in the pattern `user:apikey`)

For example, specify the environment variables like this:

```bash
CONJUR_ACCOUNT=myorg
CONJUR_CREDENTIALS=host/myhost.example.com:sb0ncv1yj9c4w2e9pb1a2s
CONJUR_APPLIANCE_URL=https://conjur.myorg.com/api
```

Note that if you are connecting as a host, the login should be prefixed with `host/`. For example: `host/myhost.example.com`,
not just `myhost.example.com`.

In addition, to run the integration tests you will need to load a Conjur policy. Save this file as `root.yml`:

```yaml
- !policy
  id: test
  body:
    - !variable
      id: testVariable
```

To load the policy, use the CLI command `conjur policy load root root.yml`

## Basic Usage

### Creating a Conjur Instance

A `Conjur` instance provides access to the individual Conjur services. To create one, you'll need the environment
variables as described above. You will typically create a Conjur instance from these values in the following way:

```java
Conjur conjur = new Conjur();

```

where the Conjur object is logged in to the account & ready for use.


### Variable Operations

Conjur variables store encrypted, access-controlled data. The most common thing a variable stores is a secret.
A variable can have one or more (up to 20) secrets associated with it, and ordered in reverse chronological order.

You will typically add secrets to variables & retrieve secrets from variables in the following way:

```java
Conjur conjur = new Conjur();

conjur.variables().addSecret(VARIABLE_KEY, VARIABLE_VALUE);

String retrievedSecret = conjur.variables().retrieveSecret(VARIABLE_KEY);
```


### SSL Certificates

By default, the Conjur appliance generates and uses self-signed SSL certificates. You'll need to configure
Java to trust them. You can accomplish this by loading the Conjur certificate into the Java keystore.
First, you'll need a copy of this certificate, which you can get using the [Conjur CLI](https://developer.conjur.net/cli).
Once you've installed the command line tools, you can run

```bash
conjur init
```

and enter the required information at the prompts.  This will save the certificate to a file like `"conjur-mycompany.pem"`
in your HOME directory.  Java doesn't deal with the *pem* format, so next you'll need to convert it to the *der* format:

```bash
openssl x509 -outform der -in conjur-yourcompany.pem -out conjur-yourcompany.der
```

Next, you'll need to locate your JRE home.   On my machine it's `/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/`.  We'll export
this path to $JRE_HOME for convenience. If the file `$JRE_HOME/lib/security/cacerts` doesn't exist (you might need to be
root to see it), you've got the wrong path for your JRE_HOME.  Once you've found it, you can add the appliance's cert
to your keystore like this:

```bash
keytool -import -alias conjur-youraccount -keystore "$JRE_HOME/lib/security/cacerts"  -file ./conjur-youraccount.der
```

## JAX-RS Implementations

The Conjur API client uses the JAX-RS standard to make requests to the Conjur web services.  In the future we plan to
remove this dependency, but for the time being you may need to change the JAX-RS implementation to conform to your
environment and application dependencies.  For example, in a JBoss server environment, you should use the RESTlet
implementation.  The Conjur API uses Apache CXF by default.  You can replace that dependency in `pom.xml` to use an
alternative implementation.
